- [ ] Basic 3D rendering (vertex buffers, index buffers)
- [ ] Texture support and sampling
- [ ] Render passes and framebuffers
- [ ] Post-processing effects

### Tools & QOL

- [ ] Logging and debugging utilities
- [ ] Configuration system
- [ ] Hot-reload support for shaders and assets
- [ ] UI framework for in-engine debugging (imgui?)
